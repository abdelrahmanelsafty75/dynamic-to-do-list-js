# Advanced Application of JavaScript – To-Do List Application

## 📌 Project Overview

Welcome to the **Advanced Application of JavaScript** project.  
In this project, you will build a **dynamic To-Do List application** that allows users to **add, display, and remove tasks**. This project focuses on utilizing **advanced DOM manipulation techniques** to create an interactive and dynamic user experience.

The application will also use **localStorage** to persist tasks, ensuring that data remains available even after the browser is closed or refreshed.

By the end of this project, you will have a fully functional To-Do List application that demonstrates your understanding of advanced JavaScript concepts and your ability to build dynamic web applications.
